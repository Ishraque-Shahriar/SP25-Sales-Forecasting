# Quarterly Sales Forecasting with Grid Search Optimization

This project aims to accurately predict quarterly sales (Q8 and Q9) for 75 companies using historical data from the previous seven quarters, alongside relevant economic indicators. The approach combines preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model optimization using Grid Search to minimize the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## 📁 Project Structure

```

## 🚀 Features

- Time-based train-test split
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Integration of economic indicators
- Hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search
- Final model trained and evaluated for predictive accuracy on Q8 and Q9

## 🧠 Models & Tools

- **Scikit-learn**: Modeling, pipelines, and Grid Search
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visualizations

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/quarterly-sales-forecasting.git
    cd quarterly-sales-forecasting
    ```

2. Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Launch the notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook final_submission_q8_q9_gridsearch.ipynb
    ```

## 📊 Dataset
