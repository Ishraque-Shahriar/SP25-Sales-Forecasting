# Quarterly Sales Forecasting with Grid Search Optimization

This project aims to accurately predict quarterly sales (Q8 and Q9) for 75 companies using historical data from the previous seven quarters, alongside relevant economic indicators. The approach combines preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model optimization using Grid Search to minimize the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## 📁 Project Structure

```
final_submission_q8_q9_gridsearch.ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with complete modeling pipeline
```

## 🚀 Features

- Time-based train-test split
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Integration of economic indicators
- Hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search
- Final model trained and evaluated for predictive accuracy on Q8 and Q9

## 🧠 Models & Tools

- **Scikit-learn**: Modeling, pipelines, and Grid Search
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visualizations
- **AutoGluon** (optional): Ensemble modeling for performance comparison

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
